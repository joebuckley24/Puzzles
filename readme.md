## Instructions ##

A little while ago we asked solvers to smoosh as many of the 50 U.S. states into a 5-by-5 grid as possible.

Now we’re at it again! Once more, your goal is to score **as many points as possible** by placing **U.S. states** in a 5-by-5 grid.

*   States can be spelled by making **King’s moves** from square to square. (See the example.)
*   This time around, the score for a state is its **population** in the [2020 U.S. Census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_census#State_rankings "census"). So, for example, CALIFORNIA scores 39,538,223 points.
*   In the true spirit of the puzzle’s title, you may “alter” the name of a state by _at most one letter_. “Altering” a state means replacing a letter with another letter. (So NEW**P**ORK, NEWYOR**F**, and NEWYORK would all score for NEWYORK, but NEWYRK and NEWY**RO**K would not.)
*   If a state appears multiple times in your grid, it only scores once.

The 3-by-3 example above scores **32,913,047 points**, for Illinois (Inlinois), Ohio, Utah (Atah), Iowa (Ioha), and Idaho (Ieaho).

To send in your entry, please render your grid as **one unbroken 25-digit string** by concatenating the rows. (The 3-by-3 grid from the example would be “thoainesl”.)
